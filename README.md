# MCP Server for FTP Access

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@alxspiker/mcp-server-ftp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@alxspiker/mcp-server-ftp)

This Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides tools for interacting with FTP servers. It allows Claude.app to list directories, download and upload files, create directories, and delete files/directories on FTP servers.

## Features

- **List Directory Contents**: View files and folders on the FTP server
- **Download Files**: Retrieve file content from the FTP server
- **Upload Files**: Create new files or update existing ones
- **Create Directories**: Make new folders on the FTP server
- **Delete Files/Directories**: Remove files or directories

## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install mcp-server-ftp for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@alxspiker/mcp-server-ftp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @alxspiker/mcp-server-ftp --client claude
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or higher
- Claude for Desktop (or other MCP-compatible client)

### Building from Source

#### Linux/macOS
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alxspiker/mcp-server-ftp.git
cd mcp-server-ftp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

#### Windows
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alxspiker/mcp-server-ftp.git
cd mcp-server-ftp

# Run the Windows build helper script
build-windows.bat
```

The `build-windows.bat` script handles dependency installation and building on Windows systems, with fallback options if the TypeScript compiler has issues.

## Configuration

To use this server with Claude for Desktop, add it to your configuration file:

### MacOS/Linux
Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ftp-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-server-ftp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "FTP_HOST": "ftp.example.com",
        "FTP_PORT": "21",
        "FTP_USER": "your-username",
        "FTP_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "FTP_SECURE": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Windows
Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ftp-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\mcp-server-ftp\\build\\index.js"],
      "env": {
        "FTP_HOST": "ftp.example.com",
        "FTP_PORT": "21",
        "FTP_USER": "your-username",
        "FTP_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "FTP_SECURE": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Windows Build Issues

If you encounter build issues on Windows:

1. Use the provided `build-windows.bat` script which handles common build issues
2. Make sure Node.js and npm are properly installed
3. Try running the TypeScript compiler directly: `npx tsc`
4. If you still have issues, you can use the pre-compiled files in the `build` directory by running:
   ```
   node path\to\mcp-server-ftp\build\index.js
   ```

## Configuration Options

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| `FTP_HOST` | FTP server hostname or IP address | localhost |
| `FTP_PORT` | FTP server port | 21 |
| `FTP_USER` | FTP username (supports encryption) | anonymous |
| `FTP_PASSWORD` | FTP password (supports encryption) | (empty string) |
| `FTP_SECURE` | Use secure FTP (FTPS) | false |
| `FTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 64-character hex AES-256 key for decrypting credentials — **do not put this in your MCP config file** (see [Credential Encryption](#credential-encryption)) | (disabled) |

## Credential Encryption

Storing plaintext passwords in your Claude config file is a security risk. The server supports AES-256-GCM encryption for `FTP_USER` and `FTP_PASSWORD` so the config only ever contains ciphertext.

`FTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is the master key that decrypts those values. It **must not** be stored in the same config file as the encrypted credentials — if an attacker can see the config they would have both the ciphertext and the key. Instead, store the key in the **OS keychain** or set it in the **real process environment** (e.g. your shell profile), both of which are described below.

### 1. Generate an encryption key

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Keep this key secret — treat it like a master password.

### 2. Store the key securely

#### Option A — OS keychain (recommended)

The server uses [`keytar`](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar) to read from the native OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service). Install it as an optional dependency and run the `store-key` helper once:

```bash
npm install keytar   # one-time, requires native build tools
npm run build
npm run store-key -- <your-64-char-hex-key>
```

From that point on the server loads the key at start-up automatically — no `FTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` entry is needed in your MCP config.

> **Linux prerequisite:** `libsecret` must be installed (`sudo apt install libsecret-1-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu).

#### Option B — real process environment

Set `FTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in your shell profile (e.g. `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or as a Windows system environment variable) so it is present in the real OS environment but **not** in the Claude Desktop config file:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export FTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your-64-char-hex-key>
```

Restart your shell and then restart Claude Desktop so it inherits the variable.

### 3. Encrypt a credential value

Once the key is available (via keychain or environment), encrypt each credential:

```bash
npm run build
npm run encrypt-env -- <plaintext-value>
```

The output is a self-contained encrypted string in the format `enc:<iv_hex>:<tag_hex>:<ciphertext_hex>`.

### 4. Use the encrypted values in your config

Because the key is stored in the OS keychain or the real environment, **omit `FTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` from the config file entirely**. Values that do not start with `enc:` are treated as plaintext, so you can encrypt selectively.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ftp-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-server-ftp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "FTP_HOST": "ftp.example.com",
        "FTP_PORT": "21",
        "FTP_USER": "enc:aabbcc...:ddeeff...:112233...",
        "FTP_PASSWORD": "enc:aabbcc...:ddeeff...:112233...",
        "FTP_SECURE": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notice there is no `FTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the `env` block — the server retrieves it from the OS keychain (or real process environment) at start-up.

## Usage

After configuring and restarting Claude for Desktop, you can use natural language to perform FTP operations:

- "List the files in the /public directory on my FTP server"
- "Download the file /data/report.txt from the FTP server"
- "Upload this text as a file called notes.txt to the FTP server"
- "Create a new directory called 'backups' on the FTP server"
- "Delete the file obsolete.txt from the FTP server"
- "Remove the empty directory /old-project from the FTP server"

## Available Tools

| Tool Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `list-directory` | List contents of an FTP directory |
| `download-file` | Download a file from the FTP server |
| `upload-file` | Upload a file to the FTP server |
| `create-directory` | Create a new directory on the FTP server |
| `delete-file` | Delete a file from the FTP server |
| `delete-directory` | Delete a directory from the FTP server |

## Security Considerations

- Use the [Credential Encryption](#credential-encryption) feature to avoid storing plaintext passwords in your config file.
- Store `FTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the **OS keychain** (`npm run store-key`) or your **real process environment** — never in the same config file as the encrypted credentials.
- Consider using FTPS (secure FTP) by setting `FTP_SECURE=true` if your server supports it.
- The server creates temporary files for uploads and downloads in your system's temp directory.
